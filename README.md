And guided by Martin Raskin

## Description
Using voice detection, text-to-speech ([gTTS](https://pypi.org/project/gTTS/)), a large language model ([PaLM API](https://developers.generativeai.google/)), and a transcription service ([Faster-Whisper](https://github.com/guillaumekln/faster-whisper)), we have created a holistic experience to improve English speaking.<br>
The product aspires to serve those who seek to improve their spoken language skills with a conversation-based approach. It also includes a testing module that grades the user based on their fluency, grammar, and ability to provide certain information.
